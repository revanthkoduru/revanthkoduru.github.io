abstract: We present the first 3D phase-field simulation framework for ferroelectric (FE) Hf1âˆ’xZrxO2 (HZO) based MFIM stack that self-consistently couples grain-growth, multi-domain (MD) polarization ( P ) switching and electrostatics. Based on 3D grain-growth models, time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equations and Poisson's equations, our framework captures the effects of polycrystalline grain size/shape distribution and inter- and intra-grain domain interactions. Using our model, we first analyze the implication of multi-domain P -switching in a single grain signifying the correlation of different macroscopic properties with respect to the crystal angle. Then we analyze, how the F -switching in one grain affects the P -switching in the neighboring grains. Next, we focus on the P -switching in a multi-grain scenario and analyze the sample-to-sample variations and cycle-to-cycle stochasticity in a small area FE sample. Finally, we show how FE thickness scaling (from 7nm to 3nm) can reduce variation and stochasticity in an MFIM stack by approximately 30%.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Introduces novel 3D multi-grain phase-field simulation framework for ferroelectric HZO based MFIM stacks unveiling insights into domain interactions, stocastic behavior and device-to-device variations and highlighting the potential thickness scaling benifits.
