abstract: Ferroelectric devices have gained significant interest, owing to their diverse range of applications in fields such as non-volatile memories, steep-slope transistors, neuromorphic and in-memory computing. Accurate modeling of ferroelectric devices is crucial to optimize these devices for different applications and design high-performance circuits. This article presents an overview of the current state of ferroelectric modeling at material, device, and circuit levels. We examine the unique aspects and limitations of the current modeling techniques and highlight potential areas of further research to advance this field.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
